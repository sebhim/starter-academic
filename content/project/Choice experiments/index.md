title: Preference elicitation using choice experiments
summary: While a choice experiment is also central to my PhD (WOOP valuation), I also got involved in several other projects, which use choice experiments to elicit preferences in health care. I am also affiliated to the Erasmus Choice Modelling Center ([ECMC](https://www.erim.eur.nl/choice-modelling/)).
