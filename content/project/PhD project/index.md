Initial description of the PhD topic:

The monetary value of health and wellbeing gains remains understudied. We will develop and 
use methods, explicitly aimed to produce societal monetary values of health and well-being 
gains. Therefore, we aim to develop a framework for measuring quality of care in monetary 
terms. Such values also include equity considerations. There may be differences in weighting 
gains for men vs. women, elderly versus young or severely versus mildly ill beneficiaries. The 
developed methods may be used in future studies, and results may inform decision makers 
throughout Europe.
