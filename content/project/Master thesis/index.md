title: Master thesis
summary: In my master thesis project, I examined whether the introduction of a prospective payment system (DRG) influenced the average lenght of stay in German hospitals. As I had to use state aggregate data (finding funding for data acquisition was difficult for a master thesis), the analysis has several limitations. OVerall, it appears that the DRG introduction did not considerably affect the lenght of stay.

Title: Does the introduction of a prospective payment system influence the length of stay in hospitals? A quantitative analysis using aggregated data from Germany

Supervisor: Andreas Schmid (University of Bayreuth)

Abstract:

This paper investigates whether the introduction of a prospective payment system in
the German inpatient sector in 2004 had an effect on the average length of
hospitalizations. A depiction of the features of the new reimbursement system and its
predecessor is followed by a discussion of the relevance and development of the
average length of hospital stays. Providing a short overview of relevant aspects of
principal-agent theory rounds of the introductory chapters. An extensive literature
review on the theoretical and empirical findings on the impact of the introduction of
prospective payment systems builds the foundation on which an economic model for
hospitals under prospective payment is constructed. According to the results of the
review and the implications of the economic model, the hypothesis was formulated that
the DRG introduction led to the politically intended decrease of length of stay in German
hospitals. The analysis continues with summarizing key elements of the aggregated data
set on the full sample of German hospitals from 2000 to 2012, utilized to test this
hypothesis. The econometric approach and the used truncated Poisson model are
described in detail before the general results are presented and discussed. These results
allow the conclusion that there has been a small reduction of the length of
hospitalizations due to the DRG introduction. However, several limitations, mainly
attributed to the used data, have to be considered when interpreting the results. The
depiction of these limitations and a subsumption of the results in a broader context
complete this paper.
