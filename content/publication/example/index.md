Abstract: Decisions on interventions or policy alternatives affecting health can be informed by economic evaluations, like cost‐benefit or cost‐utility analyses. In this context, there is a need for valid estimates of the monetary equivalent value of health (gains), which are often expressed in € per quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). Obtaining such estimates remains methodologically challenging, with a recent addition to the health economists' toolbox, which is based on well‐being data: The well‐being valuation approach. Using general population panel data from Germany, we put this approach to the test by investigating several empirical and conceptual challenges, such as the appropriate functional specification of income utility, the choice of health utility tariffs, or the health state dependence of consumption utility. Depending on specification, the bulk of estimated € per QALY values ranged from €20,000–60,000, with certain specifications leading to more considerable deviations, underlining persistent practical challenges when applying the well‐being valuation methodology to health and QALYs. Based on our findings, we formulate recommendations for future research and applications.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper we attempted to estimate a monetary value of a QALY for Germany based on data from the SOEP panel using the well-being valuation approach.
