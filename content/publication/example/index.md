Abstract: Cost-utility analysis compares the monetary cost of health interventions to the associ-ated  health  consequences  expressed  using  quality-adjusted  life  years  (QALYs). At  which threshold the ratio of both is still acceptable is a highly contested issue. Obtaining societal valuations of the monetary value of a QALY can help in setting such threshold values but it remains methodologically challenging. A recent study applied the well-being valuation approach to calculate such a monetary value using a compensating income variation approach. We explore the feasibility of this approach in a different context, using large-scale panel data from Germany. We investigate several important empirical and conceptual challenges such as the appropriate functional specification of income and the health state dependence of consumption utility. The estimated monetary values range from EUR 20,000-60,000 with certain specifications leading to considerable deviations, underlining persistent practical challenges when applying the well-being valuation methodology to QALYs. Recommendations for future applications are formulated.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper we attempted to estimate a monetary value of a QALY for Germany based on data from the SOEP panel using the well-being valuation approach.
