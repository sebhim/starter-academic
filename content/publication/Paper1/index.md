Abstract: The ICECAP-O and the ICECAP-A are validated capability well-being instruments. To be used in eco- nomic evaluations, multidimensional instruments require weighting of the distinguished well-being states. These weights are usually obtained through ex ante preference elicitation (i.e., decision utility) but could also be based on experienced utility. This article describes the development of value sets for ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A based on experienced utility and compares them with current decision utility weights. Data from 2 cross-sectional samples corresponding to the target groups of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A were used in 2 separate analy- ses. The utility impacts of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A levels were assessed through regression models using a com- posite measure of subjective well-being as a proxy for experienced utility. The observed utility impacts were rescaled to match the 0 to 1 range of the existing value set. The calculated experienced utility values were similar to the decision utility weights for some of the ICECAP dimensions but deviated for others. The largest differences were found for weights of the ICECAP-O dimension enjoyment and the ICECAP-A dimensions attachment and autonomy. The results suggest a different weighting of ICECAP-O and ICECAP-A levels if experienced utility is used instead of decision utility.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this first paper of my PhD project, we used an alternatve approach to estimate utility weights for two capability well-being instruments (ICECAP-A and ICECAP-O).
