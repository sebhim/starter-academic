Abstract: Objective: Health economic evaluations using common health-related quality of life measures may fall short in adequately incorporating all relevant benefits of health and social care interventions targeted at older people. The Well-being of Older People measure (WOOP) is a broader well-being measure that comprises nine well-being domains. The objective of this study was to estimate a utility tariff for the WOOP, to facilitate its application in cost-utility analyses. Methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) with duration approach was set up and fielded among 2,012 in- dividuals from the Netherlands aged 65 years and above. Matched pairwise choice tasks, colour-coding and level overlap were used to reduce the cognitive burden of the DCE. The choice tasks were created using a Bayesian heterogeneous D-efficient design. The estimation procedure accommodated for nonlinear time preferences via an exponential discounting function. Results: The estimation results showed that ‘physical health’, ‘mental health’, and ‘making ends meet’ were the most important well-being domains for older people, followed by ‘independence’ and ‘living situation’. Of somewhat lesser importance were domains like ‘social life’, ‘receiving support’ and ‘feeling useful’. The gener- ated utility tariffs can be used to translate well-being states described with the WOOP to a utility score between −0.616 and 1. Conclusions: This study established a tariff for the WOOP, which will facilitate its use in economic evaluations of health and social care interventions targeted at older people, first of all in the Netherlands.
