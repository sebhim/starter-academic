abstract = {Aim: This study estimates the societal benefits of using biologics like secukinumab (SEC) instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treating patients with ankylosing spondylitis in Germany. Materials {\&} methods: A Markov and a population model were used to predict the functional impairment of German ankylosing spondylitis patients using SEC or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This was translated into avoided productivity losses, which were valued according to gross value added. Results: The productivity impairment of SEC users was predicted to decrease by 20 percentage points, corresponding to 12.8 and 32.7 million hours in paid and unpaid work and a monetary value of €1.6 billion from 2016 to 2030. Accounting for economic spillover effects increases the societal value to € 3.3 billion. Conclusion: The improvements in functional impairment due to biologics could lead to sizable productivity effects.},

abstract = {Objectives: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is associated with serious productivity impairment. Secukinumab, a fully human IL-17A inhibitor, provides sustained relief from PsA symptoms. This study estimates the societal economic benefits of using secukinumab instead of conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for treating patients with active PsA in Germany from 2016 to 2030. Methods: A Markov and a population model simulated the functional impairment of German PsA patients. The relationship between functional impairment and work productivity was used to determine the productivity difference in the populations treated with secukinumab and csDMARDs. The corresponding gains in productive time were allocated to paid and unpaid activities and valued according to gross value added (GVA). Since increased productivity has the potential to stimulate greater macroeconomic effects, indirect and induced GVA effects were calculated as well. Results: The use of secukinumab reduces the productivity impairment in the target population on average by 13 percentage points. This difference could generate 32 million active and productive hours until the year 2030, which translates to GVA equivalents of €1.3 billion. Including indirect and induced effects yield an economic estimate of €2.7 billion GVA equivalent. Conclusions: The improvements in PsA-related functional impairment could lead to sizable productivity effects within the economy.},

abstract = {In this study, we assessed the productivity gains associated with the use of obinutuzumab in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (G-chemo) in first-line treatment among follicular lymphoma patients. Health benefits, measured as an increase in progression-free survival, were translated into productivity gains in both paid and unpaid work using gross value added as productivity measure. From 2017 to 2030, 11,870 overall progression-free years can be gained by utilizing obinutuzumab. These progression-free years correspond to undiscounted productivity gains of about €187.9 million in paid work and about €535.9 million in unpaid work. Our study shows that the benefits of the use of obinutuzumab in the first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma extend beyond clinical advantages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Quality of life measures going beyond health, like the ICECAP-A, are gaining importance in health technology assessment. The assessment of the monetary value of gains in this broader quality of life is needed to use these measurements in a cost-effectiveness framework. METHODS We applied the well-being valuation approach to calculate a first monetary value for capability well-being in comparison to health, derived by ICECAP-A and EQ-5D-5L, respectively. Data from an online survey administered in February 2018 to a representative sample of UK citizens aged 18-65 was used (N = 1512). To overcome the endogeneity of income, we applied an instrumental variable regression. Several alternative model specifications were calculated to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS The base case empirical estimate for the implied monetary value of a year in full capability well-being was {\pounds}66,597. The estimate of the monetary value of a QALY, obtained from the same sample and using the same methodology amounted to {\pounds}30,786, which compares well to previous estimates from the willingness to pay literature. Throughout the conducted robustness checks, the value of capability well-being was found to be between 1.7 and 2.6 times larger than the value of health. CONCLUSION While the applied approach is not without limitations, the generated insights, especially concerning the relative magnitude of valuations, may be useful for decision-makers having to decide based on economic evaluations using the ICECAP-A measure or, to a lesser extent, other (capability) well-being outcome measures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Background: Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have a five times higher stroke risk. For more than 50 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the primary medication for stroke prevention. Apixaban, a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC), has demonstrated better efficacy and safety characteristics than the VKA warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial. This study aims to quantify the potential societal effects of using apixaban instead of VKA in the German NVAF population from 2017 to 2030. Methods: Using an existing Markov model and a dynamic population approach, we modelled the health benefits of apixaban in patients with NVAF compared to VKA therapy in the German population from 2017 to 2030. Results: The results represent the extrapolated direct long-term health benefits of apixaban over VKA therapy for the German NVAF population. From 2017 until 2030, the use of apixaban instead of a VKA could avoid 52,185 major clinical events. This includes 15,383 non-fatal strokes or SEs, 22,483 non-fatal major bleeds, and 14,319 all-cause deaths, which correspond to 109,887 life years gained. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that using apixaban instead of VKA for stroke prevention can lead to considerable reduction in cardiovascular events.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart {\textperiodcentered} New York. Aim This study investigates the health economic potential of a care management approach which is an integrated post-stroke service for patients being back at home after acute and rehabilitative care. Method In a decision-tree model based on data derived from the literature and expert judgements 4 patient pathways are compared for up to 36 months after the event of stroke: care management and standard care in case of needs based and inadequate service provision. Results In the short-term a needs based post-stroke service leads to higher costs due to a comprehensive provision of medical AIDS. These additional costs, however, can be compensated by savings through a prevention of adverse events, decreased long-term care, and mortality over a period of approximately 5 months. Conclusion A comprehensive needs assessment, use of effective medical AIDS and the integration of patients into decision making processes contribute to an enhanced functional ability and associated costs.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness from the payer perspective of using dermatologists versus pediatricians to treat acne in adolescents ages 10-18. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to explore outcomes over a 2-year period from the US private payer perspective. Patients ages 10-18 with acne entered the model under the “dermatologist” and “pediatrician” conditions. In each 3-month cycle, each modeled patient received topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide (BP), antibiotics, or no treatment, and could progress to an acne-free state or remain in an acne state. Results: The average patient spent 42.3{\%} of the time in acne-free states under the dermatologist condition and 28.0{\%} of the time in acne-free states under the pediatrician condition. The cohort of 1000 patients experienced 1900 total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of {\$}2.33 million in the dermatologist condition and 1883 total QALYs at a cost of {\$}1.62 million in the pediatrician condition, yielding an ICER of {\$}40,000/QALY. Most sensitivity analyses confirmed the base case results. Conclusion: Dermatologist treatment appears cost-effective related to producing additional QALYs at a cost of less than {\$}100,000 per QALY gained. Health plans should consider creating incentives to direct enrollees to dermatologists for acne treatment.},
