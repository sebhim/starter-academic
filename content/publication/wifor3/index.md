Abstract: Despite effective treatment options, follicular lymphoma is still incurable and is associated with frequent relapses. Patients with hematological cancers are among those most likely to experience work impairment due to their condition. Novel treatments such as an obinutuzumab-based chemother- apy, however, can improve patients’ progression-free survival considerably and enable them to pursue their everyday activities and participate in the labor market. In this study, we quantify how much work productivity can be generated by treating patients with an obinutuzumab-based therapy instead of with the alternative standard therapy. Our results show that, when taking together all expected new follicular lymphoma patients in Germany from 2017 to 2030, the overall productivity that can potentially be gen- erated amounts to €723.8 million, including productivity from both paid work and unpaid work such as housekeeping or childcare.
