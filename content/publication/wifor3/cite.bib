abstract = {In this study, we assessed the productivity gains associated with the use of obinutuzumab in combination with chemoimmunotherapy (G-chemo) in first-line treatment among follicular lymphoma patients. Health benefits, measured as an increase in progression-free survival, were translated into productivity gains in both paid and unpaid work using gross value added as productivity measure. From 2017 to 2030, 11,870 overall progression-free years can be gained by utilizing obinutuzumab. These progression-free years correspond to undiscounted productivity gains of about €187.9 million in paid work and about €535.9 million in unpaid work. Our study shows that the benefits of the use of obinutuzumab in the first-line treatment of follicular lymphoma extend beyond clinical advantages.},
