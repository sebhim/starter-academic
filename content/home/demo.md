Many people may feel unease when reading about Health "Economics" in general, the comparison of health outcomes to costs, or defining how much a certain health gain should cost.

I cannot see on what <i>ethical</i> grounds you can ignore the adverse consequences of your actions on other people."</b></font></center>
